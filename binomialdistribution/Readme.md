# Hypergeometric Distribution
This calculator helps leaning the probability of drawing cards based on deck and hand size.

> In probability theory and statistics, the hypergeometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of {\displaystyle k}k successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in {\displaystyle n}n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size {\displaystyle N}N that contains exactly {\displaystyle K}K objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure. In contrast, the binomial distribution describes the probability of {\displaystyle k}k successes in {\displaystyle n}n draws with replacement.
